# tic-tac-toe

This is a simple tic-tac-toe game to run on terminal and play with another person on the same computer.

## Purpose

Learn more about Rust files structure, furter I wanna change all clones on this code to smart pointers and learn more about it.
One of my biggests challenges whith this project, is make playable between two player on the same LAN, IDK how to do this at this point, but I will learn.
Some code can be maked with another approach on this project, but I created this implementation, so I'm happy with the result.

### WIP
- Make playable in a LAN.
- Change clones by smart pointers.
- Give the chance to play more than one round on a run.
